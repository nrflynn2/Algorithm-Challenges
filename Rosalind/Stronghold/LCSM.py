# Finding a Shared Motif
# ======================
# 
# A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member
# of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common
# substring if a longer common substring of the collection does not exist. For
# example, CG is a common substring of ACGTACGT and AACCGGTATA, whereas GTA is a
# longest common substring. Note that multiple longest common substrings may
# exist.
# 
# Given: A collection of k DNA strings (of length at most 1 kbp each; kâ‰¤100).
# 
# Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions
#         exist, you may return any single solution.)
